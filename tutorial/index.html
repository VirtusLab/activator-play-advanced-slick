    <title>Play Slick with Typesafe IDs - Activator Template</title>
</head>
<body>
<div>
    <p>
        You've just created an application with the Play Slick with Typesafe IDs template. This template allows you to
        quickly create a Play application using Slick for database access. The template has been pre-configured to use
        an in-memory database called H2.

        This template was derived from Slick creator's type-safe id's idea presented on ScalaDays 2013.
    </p>

    <h2>Set up the database</h2>

    <p>
        The template you're using is already set up with an in-memory instance of the H2 database. You can leave this as
        it is and skip this section if you want to continue using this database.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is sometimes advantageous to use H2 in file mode rather than in memory. This will allow debugging through
        things like the h2-browser or other methods of access to H2. To make this change, edit the conf/application.conf
        file and find the line that specifies the default url:

        <pre><code>db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

        In order to use a file-based database, change this to

        <pre><code>db.default.url="jdbc:h2:/path/to/file</code></pre>

        You can then get access to the database by shutting down any processes (including Play) that are accessing it and
        using the following commands

        <pre><code>play</code></pre>
        <pre><code>h2-browser</code></pre>

        And then enter the same URL to access H2.
    </p>

    <p>
        To use a different database technology, use the instructions on the <a
            href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaDatabase">Play Documentation site</a>
    </p>

</div>

<div>
    <h2>Create tables</h2>

    <p>
        Play includes a function called <a
            href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Evolutions">evolutions</a> that allows the management
        of database schema changes. To use evolutions, create an evolutions folder for the default database as
        <strong>conf/evolutions/default</strong>
        then create .sql scripts that will put the database into the appropriate state. Evolutions also has the ability
        to revert the database to a previous version.

        This template uses play-slick DDL plugin that creates 1.sql file for you automatically for all tables defined in
        "model" package. To disable this feature or change package see <a href="#code/conf/application.conf"
                                                                          class="shortcut">application.conf</a> and change
        <strong>slick.default="model.*"</strong> parameter.

        In this example, this plugin will create a file called conf/evolutions/default/1.sql with the following content:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
    # --- Created by Slick DDL
    # To stop Slick DDL generation, remove this comment and start using Evolutions

    # --- !Ups

    create table "comments" (
    "id" BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "text" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    "author" BIGINT NOT NULL,
    "date" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL);

    create table "users" (
      "id" BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      "email" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      "first_name" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      "last_name" VARCHAR NOT NULL
    );

    alter table "comments" add constraint "comments_author_fk" foreign key("author") references "users"("id") on update NO ACTION on delete NO ACTION;

    # --- !Downs

    alter table "comments" drop constraint "comments_author_fk";
    drop table "comments";
    drop table "users";
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        When you load up your application, you will be prompted to apply the script(s).
    </p>

</div>

<div>
    <h2>Create the models</h2>

    <p>
        In order to create a set of models in play that will use Slick to access the database, you need to create the
        models. The Slick site at <a href="http://slick.typesafe.com">slick.typesafe.com</a>
        has an excellent set of documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        This template, however, uses small library that enables usage of type safe primary and foreign keys in
        your application. Example entity created with this library can be shown <a href="#code/app/model/User.scala" class="shortcut">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>Entity declaration contains of four parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Case class for your type-safe id. It has to <strong>extends AnyVal with BaseId</strong> and contain id
            field of type <strong>Long</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Companion object for your id. It have to extend <strong>IdCompanion[YourEntityId]</strong>. This step provides
            you with implicits needed in slick queries and Play! mappings.
        </li>
        <li>Your domain model entity. It has to <strong>extend WithId[YourEntityId]</strong>.</li>
        <li>Table definition for your entity. It <strong>extends IdTable[YourEntityId, YourEntity]</strong>, which
            accepts table name (and optionally schema name).
        </li>
    </ul>


</div>

<div>
    <h2>Gain base service methods for free!</h2>

    <p>
        When you have entity declaration you get (almost) free basic queries and service methods for it. Example is
        shown in <a href="#code/app/service/UsersService.scala" class="shortcut">UsersService</a>. It contains trait for
        queries and trait for service. This 4 lines of code enables you to save your entities, query or delete them by
        id and some more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example usage can be shown in <a href="#code/test/service/UsersServiceTest.scala" class="shortcut">UsersServiceTest</a>.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Adding next class - type-safe joins</h2>

    <p>
        Let's add new class to our model. It will be a <a href="#code/app/model/Comment.scala"
                                                          class="shortcut">Comment</a>. With an exception of class names
        and fields it's same as <a href="#code/app/model/User.scala" class="shortcut">User</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In queries for comments (<a href="#code/app/service/CommentsService.scala" class="shortcut">CommentsService</a>)
        we can now create query joining on type-safe userId:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        // parametrized query using UserId
        protected val commentsForUserQuery = for {
            userId <- Parameters[UserId]
            // type-safe join, if you pass here any other id or Long it wont compile!
            comment <- Comments if comment.authorId === userId
        } yield comment
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        Than, in <strong>CommentsService</strong> you can create service method for searching comments by userId:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        def findForUserId(userId: UserId)(implicit session: Session): Seq[Comment] =
            commentsForUserQuery.list(userId)
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        At last, let's test your new service in <a href="#code/test/service/CommentsServiceTest.scala" class="shortcut">CommentsServiceTest</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        object UsersService extends UsersService
        object CommentsService extends CommentsService

        val user = User(None, "test@email.com", "Krzysztof", "Nowak")
        val userId = UsersService save user

        val comments = Seq(
            Comment(None, "It's nice", userId, DateTime.now()),
            Comment(None, "It's very nice", userId, DateTime.now()),
            Comment(None, "Those comments are not spam", userId, DateTime.now())
        )

        val commentIds = CommentsService saveAll comments

        val queriedComments = CommentsService findForUserId userId

        queriedComments.size must be_=== (comments.size)
        queriedComments.flatMap(_.id) must containAllOf(commentIds)
    </code></pre>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Additional goodies</h2>

    <p>
        Your type-safe IDs are designed not only to work with SLick, but also with Play! framework internals. You can
        also use them in mappings (beloved <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaForms"
                                              target="_blank">Play! forms API</a>) and <a
            href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaRouting" target="_blank">routes</a> without any
        added work and benefit from type-safety in you application.
    </p>

    <p>Using IDs in form mappings:</p>
    <pre><code>
        val userMapping = Form(
            mapping(
                "id" -> of[UserId], // it will be read from Long and packed to UserId
                "email" -> email,
                "firstName" -> text,
                "lastName" -> text
            )(User.apply)(User.unappply)
        )
    </code></pre>

    <p>Using IDs in routes:</p>
    <pre><code>
        // it will be read from Long and packed to UserId, so you can use it like that in controller method
        /user/show/:id      controllers.UsersController.show(id: model.UserId)
    </code></pre>
</div>

<div>
    <h2> View the App</h2>

    <p>
        Once the application has been compiled and the server started, your application can be accessed at: <a
            href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a><br/>
        Check in <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> to see the server status.<br/>
        When you make an HTTP request to that URL, the Play server figures out what code to execute which will handle
        the request and return a response. In this application the request handler for requests to the root URL (e.g.
        "/") are handled by a Java Controller. You can use Java and Scala to create your controllers.<br/>
        Controllers asynchronously return HTTP responses of any content type (i.e. HTML, JSON, binary). To see a JSON
        response produced by a Scala controller, click the "Get JSON Message" button. This uses AJAX via jQuery to get
        data from the server and then display that on the web page.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2> Code Overview</h2>

    <p>A Play application has very few required files. This example tries to illustrate a number of key concepts in Play
        so it has a handful of files to explain. The <a href="#code/app" class="shortcut">app</a> directory contains the
        application's source code, including Java, Scala, server-side templates, and server-side compiled assets for the
        browser (e.g. JavaScript, CoffeeScript, LESS). The <a href="#code/conf" class="shortcut">conf</a> directory
        contains the <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a> config file and the <a
                href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file</a>. The <a href="#code/project"
                                                                                      class="shortcut">project</a>
        directory contains the SBT build information for the app. The default place for static assets (e.g. images,
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is the <a href="#code/public" class="shortcut">public</a> directory. Unit, functional,
        and integration tests (Java and Scala) go in the <a href="#code/test" class="shortcut">test</a> directory.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2> HTTP Routing</h2>

    <p>
        The <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file contains mappings between HTTP request verbs
        &amp; paths and the code that controller method that handles the requests. Route paths can be parametrized to
        support RESTful style URLs. The following mapping will handle HTTP GET requests to "/" using the <strong>controllers.MainController.index</strong>
        method:
    <pre><code>GET / controllers.MainController.index</code></pre>
    You can try out the routing by first making a request to an unmatched route, like: <a
        href="http://localhost:9000/foo" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000/foo</a><br/>
    This should produce an error because there isn't a route that matches the request.
    Then edit the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> to include a new route:
    <pre><code>GET /foo controllers.MainController.index</code></pre>
    Now retry the request and you should see the default index page.<br/>
    By default the routes are compiled by Play so that they can be used in a type-safe way. This prevents issues caused
    by incorrect URL usages.

<div>
    <h2> Controllers</h2>

    <p>
        HTTP GET requests to <a href="http://localhost:9000/" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000/</a> are handled by
        the index method defined in the <a href="#code/app/controllers/MainController.java" class="shortcut">MainController.java</a>
        file. This static method returns a <strong>Result</strong> which in this case consists of a server-side rendered
        template and an HTTP 200 response which is represented by the <strong>ok</strong> method call. You can also use
        non-static methods along with Dependency Injection frameworks like Spring, Guice, and CDI.
        <!-- todo:  (<a href="http://TODO" target="_blank">Learn More...</a>) --><br/>
        You can change the "Hello from Java" string in <a href="#code/app/controllers/MainController.java"
                                                          class="shortcut">MainController.java</a> a different value,
        like "Hello from Play", then save the file and reload <a href="http://localhost:9000/" target="_blank">the index
        page</a> in your browser. Play will automatically recompile the controller and you should immediately see your
        changes.<br/>
        If your changes result in a compile error you will see the error in your browser (after a refresh) and in the <a
            href="#compile" class="shortcut">Compile Plugin</a>. Try it by removing one of the double-quotes in the
        <strong>index</strong> method's string, save the file, and reload the index page. Fix the error before you
        continue.<br/>
        There is also a Scala controller which provides an example JSON service. (Note: Play also has built-in JSON
        support in Java controllers.) You can see the JSON by opening <a href="http://localhost:9000/message"
                                                                         target="_blank">http://localhost:9000/message</a>
        in your browser. This route is also mapped in the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file
        but this time the request is handled by the <a href="#code/app/controllers/MessageController.scala"
                                                       class="shortcut">MessageController.scala</a> file's <strong>getMessage</strong>
        function. This controller returns an <strong>Action</strong> which is responsible for producing a HTTP response.
        In this case the response is a <strong>case class</strong> which is serialized to JSON. You will also notice the
        <strong>MessageController</strong> contains a function called <strong>javascriptRoutes</strong> which provides a
        mechanism for using the type-safe routes in JavaScript.

    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2> Templates</h2>

    <p>
        The <strong>MainController.index</strong> method uses a template which is compiled by Play into a function. The
        source is in the <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index.scala.html</a> file and is
        available by calling the <strong>views.html.index.render</strong> function. This template takes a parameter of a
        <strong>String</strong> so the compiled function also takes a <strong>String</strong> parameter. The default
        templating language in Play is Scala, but a number of other templating languages (like Java, Groovy, and Dust)
        can also be plugged in.<br/>
        The <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index template</a> uses the <a
            href="#code/app/views/main.scala.html" class="shortcut">main template</a> by calling the
        <strong>main</strong> function with the required parameters.<br/>
        Notice that the templates do not use hard-coded URLs and instead use Play's reverse routing, like:
    <pre><code>@routes.Assets.at("images/favicon.png")</code></pre>
    This provides a type-safe way to specify URLs in an application. If the URL to a file changes, then automatically,
    the new value will be used throughout all of the URL references. You can use the reverse router anywhere in your
    code, like redirects in controllers.<br/>
    Like controllers (and all source code in Play) you can make changes to templates which triggers a recompile. Then
    simply refresh the page to see the changes. Try it out by making a change to the <a
        href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index template</a>, saving the file, and then
    refreshing the <a href="http://localhost:9000/" target="_blank">index page</a> in your browser.

    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2> Static Assets</h2>

    <p>
        This application has a route to handle loading static assets from the <a href="#code/public" class="shortcut">public</a>
        directory:
    <pre><code>GET /assets/*file controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)</code></pre>
    A request to <a href="http://localhost:9000/assets/images/favicon.png" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000/assets/images/favicon.png</a>
    will use this route to find the <a href="#code/public/images/favicon.png" class="shortcut">favicon.png</a> file in
    the <strong>public/images</strong> directory.<br/>
    You can put any static assets into the public directory and have them accessible in this way.
    <!-- todo: Learn more -->
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2> Asset Compiler</h2>

    <p>
        Modern web applications often use compilers to generate static assets for the browser. Play has a built-in asset
        compiler which can automatically syntax check &amp; minify JavaScript, compile CoffeeScript to JavaScript, and
        compile LESS to CSS. You can also plug in other compilers into the Play's asset compiler.<br/>
        This application contains two example uses of the asset compiler. The <a
            href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/index.js" class="shortcut">index.js</a> file will automatically be syntax
        checked and minified. The minified version is can be referenced in a template with:
        <pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript'
            src='@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/index.min.js")'&gt;
            &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    You can also put CoffeeScript files with a <strong>.coffee</strong> extension in the <a
        href="#code/app/assets/javascripts" class="shortcut">app/assets/javascripts</a> directory to have them
    automatically compiled and minified.<br/>
    The <a href="#code/app/assets/stylesheets/index.less" class="shortcut">index.less</a> file will be compiled into
    both a <strong>index.css</strong> and a <strong>index.min.css</strong> file.
    <!-- todo: Learn more -->
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2> Test the App</h2>

    <p>
        This application includes a number of tests which are automatically run after each successful compile. You can
        see the test results in the <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test plugin</a>. Due to changes that you may have
        made to your application source code, some of the tests might now be failing. The source for the tests is
        located in the <a href="#code/test" class="shortcut">test</a> directory and contains both Java and Scala tests.
        The <a href="#code/test/MainControllerTest.java" class="shortcut">test/MainControllerTest.java</a> Java class
        contains a number of unit and functional tests for the <strong>MainController</strong>. The <a
            href="#code/test/IntegrationTest.java" class="shortcut">IntegrationTest.java</a> file contains an test which
        uses Solenium to test the actual UI in a browser. The default testing framework for Java in Play is JUnit, but
        you can plug any testing framework in.<br/>
        The <a href="#code/test/MessageControllerSpec.scala" class="shortcut">MessageControllerSpec.scala</a> file
        contains a functional test for the <strong>MessageController</strong>.<br/>
        If you modify a test and save the changes, then the tests will automatically be re-run.

</div>

<div>
    <h2> SBT Build</h2>

    <p>
        SBT is the build system underneath Play applications. It is responsible for resolving dependencies, compiling
        the project, running the tests, etc. The primary build definition file is the <a href="#code/build.sbt"
                                                                                         class="shortcut">build.sbt</a>
        file. In that file you will see a comma-seperated list of dependencies which can be modified to suit your needs.
        Play includes a number of libraries which can selectively be turned on/off. For instance if you want to use JPA
        with Play, uncomment the <strong>javaJpa</strong> dependency. You can also add your own dependencies in the SBT
        form:
    <pre><code>"group" % "artifact" % "version"</code></pre>
