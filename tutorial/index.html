    <title>Play Slick with type-safe IDs - Activator Template</title>
</head>
<body>
<div>
    <p>
        You've just created an application with the Play Slick with type-safe IDs template. This template combines Play
        Framework with Slick and adds tools to use type-safe IDs for your classes so you can no longer join on bad id
        field or mess up order of fields in mappings. It also provides way to create service with methods (like querying
        all, querying by id, saving or deleting), for all classes with such IDs in just 4 lines of code.

        Idea for type-safe ids was derived from Slick creator's <a
            href="http://www.parleys.com/play/51c2e20de4b0d38b54f46243/chapter63/about" target="_blank">presentation on
        ScalaDays 2013</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Set up the database</h2>

    <p>
        The template you're using is already set up with an in-memory instance of the H2 database. You can leave this as
        it is and skip this section if you want to continue using this database.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is sometimes advantageous to use H2 in file mode rather than in memory. This will allow debugging through
        things like the h2-browser or other methods of access to H2. To make this change, edit the <a
            href="#code/conf/application.conf"
            class="shortcut">conf/application.conf</a>
        file and find the line that specifies the default url:

        <pre><code>db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"</code></pre>

        In order to use a file-based database, change this to

        <pre><code>db.default.url="jdbc:h2:/path/to/file</code></pre>

        You can then get access to the database by shutting down any processes (including Play) that are accessing it and
        using the following commands

        <pre><code>activator</code></pre>
        <pre><code>h2-browser</code></pre>

        And then enter the same URL to access H2.
    </p>

    <p>
        To use a different database technology, use the instructions on the <a
            href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaDatabase">Play Documentation site</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Create tables</h2>

    <p>
        Play includes a function called <a
            href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Evolutions">evolutions</a> that allows the management
        of database schema changes. To use evolutions, create an evolutions folder for the default database as
        <code>conf/evolutions/default</code>
        then create .sql scripts that will put the database into the appropriate state. Evolutions also has the ability
        to revert the database to a previous version.

        This template uses play-slick DDL plugin that creates 1.sql file for you automatically for all tables defined in
        "model" package. To disable this feature or change package see <a href="#code/conf/application.conf"
                                                                          class="shortcut">application.conf</a> and change
        <code>slick.default="model.*"</code> parameter.

        In this example, this plugin will create a file called conf/evolutions/default/1.sql with the following content:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
    # --- Created by Slick DDL
    # To stop Slick DDL generation, remove this comment and start using Evolutions

    # --- !Ups

    create table "COMMENTS" (
    "ID" BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "TEXT" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    "AUTHOR" BIGINT NOT NULL,
    "DATE" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL);

    create table "USERS" (
      "ID" BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      "EMAIL" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      "FIRST_NAME" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      "LAST_NAME" VARCHAR NOT NULL
    );

    alter table "COMMENTS" add constraint "COMMENTS_AUTHOR_FK" foreign key("AUTHOR") references "users"("ID") on update NO ACTION on delete NO ACTION;

    # --- !Downs

    alter table "COMMENTS" drop constraint "COMMENTS_AUTHOR_FK";
    drop table "COMMENTS";
    drop table "USERS";
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        When you load up your application, you will be prompted to apply the script(s).
    </p>

<div>
    <h2>Create the models</h2>

    <p>
        This template uses small library called <a href="https://github.com/VirtusLab/unicorn" target="_blank"><i>Unicorn</i></a> that enables usage of type safe primary and foreign keys
        in your application. Example entity created with this library can be shown <a href="#code/app/model/User.scala"
                                                                                      class="shortcut">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>Entity declaration contains of four parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Case class for your type-safe id. It has to mix <code>BaseId</code> and contain id field of type
            <code>Long</code>. It is also good to extend from <code>AnyVal</code> to get unboxed values.
        </li>
        <li>Companion object for your id. It have to extend <code>IdCompanion[YourEntityId]</code>. This step provides
            you with implicits needed in slick queries and Play! mappings.
        </li>
        <li>Your domain model entity. It has to <code>extend WithId[YourEntityId]</code>.</li>
        <li>Table definition for your entity. It <code>extends IdTable[YourEntityId, YourEntity]</code>, which
            accepts table name (and optionally schema name).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In case of any problems related to Slick its' site at <a href="http://slick.typesafe.com" target="_blank">slick.typesafe.com</a>
        has an excellent set of documentation.
    </p>

<div>
    <h2>Gain base service methods for free!</h2>

    <p>
        When you have entity declaration you get (almost) free basic queries and service methods for it. Example is
        shown in <a href="#code/app/service/UsersService.scala" class="shortcut">UsersService</a>. It contains trait for
        queries and trait for service. This 4 lines of code enables you to save your entities, query or delete them by
        id and some more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example usage can be shown in <a href="#code/test/service/UsersServiceTest.scala" class="shortcut">UsersServiceTest</a>.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Adding next class - type-safe joins</h2>

    <p>
        Let's add new class to our model. It will be a <a href="#code/app/model/Comment.scala"
                                                          class="shortcut">Comment</a>. With an exception of class names
        and fields it's same as <a href="#code/app/model/User.scala" class="shortcut">User</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In queries for comments (<a href="#code/app/service/CommentsService.scala" class="shortcut">CommentsService</a>)
        we can now create query joining on type-safe userId:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        // parametrized query using UserId
        protected val commentsForUserQuery = for {
            userId <- Parameters[UserId]
            // type-safe join, if you pass here any other id or Long it wont compile!
            comment <- Comments if comment.authorId === userId
        } yield comment
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        Then, in <code>CommentsService</code> you can create service method for searching comments by userId:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        def findForUserId(userId: UserId)(implicit session: Session): Seq[Comment] =
            commentsForUserQuery.list(userId)
    </code></pre>

    <p>
        At last, let's test your new service in <a href="#code/test/service/CommentsServiceTest.scala" class="shortcut">CommentsServiceTest</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        object UsersService extends UsersService
        object CommentsService extends CommentsService

        val user = User(None, "test@email.com", "Krzysztof", "Nowak")
        val userId = UsersService save user

        val comments = Seq(
            Comment(None, "It's nice", userId, DateTime.now()),
            Comment(None, "It's very nice", userId, DateTime.now()),
            Comment(None, "Those comments are not spam", userId, DateTime.now())
        )

        val commentIds = CommentsService saveAll comments

        val queriedComments = CommentsService findForUserId userId

        queriedComments.size must be_=== (comments.size)
        queriedComments.flatMap(_.id) must containAllOf(commentIds)
    </code></pre>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Additional goodies</h2>

    <p>
        Your type-safe IDs are designed not only to work with Slick, but also with Play! framework internals. You can
        also use them in mappings (beloved <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaForms"
                                              target="_blank">Play! forms API</a>) and <a
            href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/ScalaRouting" target="_blank">routes</a> without any
        added work and benefit from type-safety in you application.
    </p>

    <p>Using IDs in form mappings:</p>
    <pre><code>
        val userMapping = Form(
            mapping(
                "id" -> of[UserId], // it will be read from Long and packed to UserId
                "email" -> email,
                "firstName" -> text,
                "lastName" -> text
            )(User.apply)(User.unappply)
        )
    </code></pre>

    <p>Using IDs in routes:</p>
    <pre><code>
        // it will be read from Long and packed to UserId, so you can use it like that in controller method
        /user/show/:id      controllers.UsersController.show(id: model.UserId)
    </code></pre>
